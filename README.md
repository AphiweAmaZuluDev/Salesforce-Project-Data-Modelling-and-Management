## 4.5. Duplicate Management (Data Quality) üõ°Ô∏è

To maintain high data quality and prevent redundant outreach, the application includes custom duplicate management rules on the `CustomLead` object.

### Matching Rule: NextGen Lead Match

This rule defines how two `CustomLead` records are determined to be potential duplicates.

| Matching Criteria | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Formula** | $\text{(CustomLead: Name ExactMatchBlank = FALSE) AND ((CustomLead: Email ExactMatchBlank = TRUE) OR (CustomLead: Phone Fuzzy: PhoneMatchBlank = FALSE)}$ |
| **Logic** | Records are considered a match if the **Name** is an exact match (and not blank), *AND* if either the **Email** is an exact match (and not blank), *OR* the **Phone** is a fuzzy match (and not blank). |

### Duplicate Rule: Prevent Duplicate Leads

| Rule Name | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prevent Duplicate Leads** | **Alert** and **Report** | This rule utilizes the **NextGen Lead Match** criteria. It alerts users when creating or editing a record that potentially matches an existing lead and prevents the user from saving the duplicate record (based on the rule's settings). |
